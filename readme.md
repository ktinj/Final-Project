## Description
Perch Review is an unbiased product recommendation application, made by users for users. A user can upload, search by keyword, and save recommendations for later purchase. This project is a MERN application and uses express-file-upload to upload images from a user's computer.

- User Story: I want to be able to create, view, and access real recommendations so that I can make, and help others make, an informed purchase more quickly.
